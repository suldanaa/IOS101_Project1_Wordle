Submitted by: **Suldana Abdulkadir Afrah**

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a couple challenges with syntax/language logic and closures.
I found closure declarations to be a bit difficult because when you aren't declaring them with a return type (for example in Exercise 4)
I found it hard to know what to reference.
Syntax was hard since I'm new to Swift but I also had some trouble differentiating when to use "self." and things of that nature.
